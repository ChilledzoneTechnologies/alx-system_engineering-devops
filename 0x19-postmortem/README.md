 process. Kept expectations lower this time... but was rewarded! strace revelead an -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) error occurring upon an attempt to access the file /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp.

Looked through files in the /var/www/html/ directory one-by-one, using Vim pattern matching to try and locate the erroneous .phpp file extension. Located it in the wp-settings.php file. (Line 137, require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.php' );).

Removed the trailing p from the line.

Tested another curl on the server. 200 A-ok!

Wrote a Puppet manifest to automate fixing of the error.
